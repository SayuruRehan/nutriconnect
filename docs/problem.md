# NutriConnect: Smart School‑Meals & Subsidy App

## A. Context & Target Users
- **Primary users:** School administrators and parents in government and low‑income schools.
- **Secondary users:** Nutrition officers and subsidy program managers.

## B. Pain Points
1. **Inefficient subsidy disbursement:**
   - Paper‑based approvals introduce delays, manual errors, and lost records.
2. **Lack of real‑time menu insights:**
   - Administrators cannot adjust menus to meet nutritional guidelines or account for seasonal availability.
3. **Poor transparency & trust:**
   - Parents and oversight bodies lack visibility into whether subsidies reach intended beneficiaries.

## C. Evidence & Scope
- The Midday Meal Scheme serves free lunches to over **120 million children** across **1.27 million** schools—making it the largest program of its kind in the world ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midday_Meal_Scheme?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
- Between June 2020 and June 2024, food inflation in India averaged **6.3%**, yet per‑student meal budgets have remained unchanged at **₹5.45** (primary) and **₹8.17** (upper primary), forcing schools to reduce nutritious ingredients and undermining dietary quality for approximately **120 million** children ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-high-food-inflation-leaves-less-lunch-boxes-poor-school-children-2024-10-11/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

**Scope of Pilot:**
- Target **5–10 schools** within a single district.
- Covers:
  1. **SLUDI**‑backed user authentication.
  2. **NDX** menu & subsidy data retrieval.
  3. **PayDPI** subsidy disbursement flow.
